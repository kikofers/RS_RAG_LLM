"""
This script is designed to find the shortest path between two nodes in a binary graph.
The binary graph's structure is this:
 * Nodes: id, label (the same as id), interval (empty), name, latitude, longitude.
 * Edges: source node, target node, type (direction), id, label (empty), interval (empty), weight (1), routes (comma-separated list of route_short_names), types (comma-separated list of route_types).
